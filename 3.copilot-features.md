## Code intellisense/completion:
Copilot does the code completion alongside us based on the current code written in a file. It auto completes the line or provide next 2-3 lines suggestion which we can accept or reject.

### How to use this feature effectively:
- Keep related files open and close unrelated files, copilot create the context from the current open files.
- Existing written code should be readable with proper names, it helps copilot to better understand the context.
- Iterate suggestions, if the first suggestion isnâ€™t perfect, hit the shortcut to cycle through alternate suggestions.


## Copilot Chat:
The superpower lies here!!! Copilot chat should be used a lot to see notifiable different in productivity gain.
Inline chat and chat in window are mostly same with with similar capabilities.

### Why to use chat:
- Chat is more powerful than auto completion feature
- Chat use GPT 4o model by default which has larger context window than GPT 3 or GPT 3.5 model which is used in auto completion
- Chat enables the use of Copilot-provided agents, commands, and variables, which helps us to create better context
- We can directly create file from the generate code in chat
- We get better explanation of the generated code
- We can use our prompt engineering skills to get desired results

### When to use copilot chat:
Mostly we use it when we want to generate large code in various scenarios. But there are more usecases as below:
- Code explanation: Asking Copilot to explain what a particular function or piece of code does.
- Debugging Assistance: Asking Copilot why an error is occurring or to suggest fixes for a specific exception.
- Writing Boilerplate Code: Creating APIs, form validations, UI components, or basic configurations, etc.
- Optimizing Code: Asking for suggestions to optimize a slow SQL query or refactor a lengthy function.
- Writing Tests: Asking Copilot to create test cases for a new feature or validate edge cases are covered
- Learning and Upskilling: Asking how to use a feature in React, write a unit test in Jest, or implement caching with Redis.
- Explaining Errors and Logs: Asking for explanations of complex stack traces or strategies to resolve a build failure.
- Generating Documentation
- Code Conversion: Converting Python code to JavaScript or SQL to NoSQL queries
- Many more

### How to use this feature effectively:
- Understand properly about chat agent, commands and chat variables
- Create a new chat for a new request, this keeps the context clean. Ask follow-up questions in the same chat.
- Proper files names also helps, @workspace agent see filenames to attach with your chat request for better context.
- Existing code readability definitely helps
- Attach known files related to your chat request using #file
- Change model like GPT 4o, Cluade 3.5 Sonnet or GPT o1 preview, whichever is giving better result


## Comment based code generation:
Instead of using comment based code generation better to use copilot chat which is more powerful.


## Test cases generation:


## Refactor code:
Use Copilot to help us write better code.

### Examples:
- Use it to write better names, press F2(rename shortcut) and copilot can provide better name as per current code context
- Refactor a large function into smaller ones
- Ask copilot about what coding design principles are breaking in current code and ask to fix it.

See more refactoring usecases with example from copilot team here: [Refactoring code with GitHub Copilot
](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/example-use-cases/refactoring-code-with-github-copilot)


## Documenting the code:
Copilot can help us write API documentation, class documentation, etc

### Examples:
```
@workspace Generate a README for this project.
```
```
Add a file-level comment summarizing its purpose.
```
```
Add comments to explain the YAML configuration.
```
```
Add comments to document the API endpoint with OpenAPI version 3.0.
```
```
Add a docstring to the calculate_sum function
```
