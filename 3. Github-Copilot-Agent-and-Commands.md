## @workspace

The @workspace has context about the code in your workspace. Use @workspace when you want Copilot to consider the structure of your project, how different parts of your code interact, or design patterns in your project. @workspace can find and attach relevant files to the request context automatically.

### Common usecases:
- Understanding the codebase: 
@workspace can help by analyzing your codebase and providing insights.
```
@workspace how is authentication implemented in the project?
```
```
@workspace how is error handling implemented in the project?
```

- Navigating and locating code:
```
@workspace find a function from project which is used for generating random alpha numeric code
```
```
@workspace find the code where api request retry capabilities are built.
```
```
@workspace where is the database connection string configured?
```

- Attach relevant files in the context:
When we are asking Copilot to do some task and we also want Copilot to find and attached relevant files in the context.
```
@workspace Write a repository function to get users greater than 18 years.
``` 
NOTE: Workspace will try to find and attach relevant files but if we know the relevant files then we should attach with #file explicitly.
```
@workspace create a README file summarizing the project's features
```
```
@workspace add a new API route for the forgot password form
```
