## Generate Unit test

Ex 1: Generate unit tests covering all positive and negative scenarios , including edge cases. use reference of create-first-repayment-request-event-handler-service.spec.ts as correct example and generate accordingly, make sure you generate providers as same format as in create-first-repayment-request-event-handler-service.spec.ts. Cover all code execution flows for maximum coverage.
